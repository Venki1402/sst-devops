- mockito - used for mocking while doing unit testing (If depends on another func. do mocking)
- line coverage -- function coverage -- class coverage
- kernel -- an Interface b/w different hardware (adapter design pattern)
- ami - amazon machine Image
- region -- vpc -- subnets
- IP --> public ip(any one can talk), private ip(only in one vpc can talk. ex: only in aws machines Internall can talk), elastic ip(crazy thing, u create one and it starys with you and you can attach it to any Instance)
- ssh is on port 22
