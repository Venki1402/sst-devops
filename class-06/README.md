# Notes

- Docker is built for the Linux OS kernel. Does it work on Windows and Mac? Yes, through the use of a hypervisor (such as Docker Desktop).
- hypervisor -- a category of software that helps to create virtual machines
- Startup of a virtual machine
  - Hardware
  - Hypervisor
  - BIOS - binary input output system -- it has hardware configureations
  - MBR - master boot record -- decides which os to load
  - boot loader - knows how to load that particular os
  - kernel
  - INIT
  - processes
  - app
- docker doesnt have its own os, it directly works with host os and hence they are light weight and very fast
- `docker ps -a` see all (even non running Instances)
- `docker exec -it` go into a docker container
- `docker commit` to create a image from a container
- `docker info` -- gives overall info like root path, storage folder, e.t.c..
- `/var/lib/docker/overlay2` - Storage Driver `vfs`
- `docker container prune` - remove all stopped containers
- `docker rmi` - used to remove images
- `docker image inspect <imageID>`
