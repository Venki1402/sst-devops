# Notes

- topics of Interest (IDK) - kubernetes, terraform
- DNS - domain name system
- load balancers - 2types - path based and Insance (load distribution)
- there are 2 types of asynchronous communication - subscriber model & message queue
- In asynchronous communication we dont need load balancers, the broker (eg kafka) will take care of it
- Event syncing -- kinda like analytics for the entire application
- Logs - used for debugging -- seperated out -- ex. splunk, datadog
