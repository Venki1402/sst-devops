# Notes

- Docker's uasge in production systems is reducing drastically... reason? kubernetes
- To Install Docker on Ubuntu
  - `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`
  - `sudo sh get-docker.sh`
- In linux machine the background process which run in a machine are called as daemons
- `systemctl status` to see daemons
- `ps -ef` to see all the processes running
- containers are light weight comapred to the os as containers are just a process and they Interact directly with host machine's os whereas vm's spin up their own whole os which is resoucre intensive
